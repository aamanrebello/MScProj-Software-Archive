# Chapter 6
Investigates the decomposed IS estimators.

Description of notebooks:

- **1_Step_MDP**: Experiments with decomposed and non-decomposed IS, PDIS and PDWIS estimators on the 1-step MDP toy problem.

- **4_State_MDP**: Experiments with decomposed and non-decomposed IS, PDIS and PDWIS estimators on the 4-state MDP toy problem.

- **Sepsis_Simulator**: This compares the decomposed and non-decomposed IS, PDIS and PDWIS estimators on the Sepsis Simulator using four different action space factorisations based on the action features.

- **Sepsis_Simulator_Coverage**: This investigates how episode coverage of evaluation policy trajectories by the behaviour policy data set varies between the factored and non-factored cases. No findings from this notebook were used in the report.
