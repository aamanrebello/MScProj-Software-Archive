# Models
These are saved neural network mapping models (PyTorch models):

- **Model 1**: Assumes $D=2$, maps (s,a) pair to factored policies and reward.

- **Model 2**: Assumes $D=3$, maps (s,a) pair to factored policies and reward.

- **Model 3**: Assumes $D=2$, maps ($\pi_b$, $\pi_e$, r) triplet to factored policies and reward.

- **Model 4**: Assumes $D=3$, maps ($\pi_b$, $\pi_e$, r) triplet to factored policies and reward.

- **Model 5**: Assumes $D=4$, maps ($\pi_b$, $\pi_e$, r) triplet to factored policies and reward.


Order of performance in general Model 4 $\approx$ Model 5 $>$ Model 3 $>$ Model 1 $\approx$ Model 2
