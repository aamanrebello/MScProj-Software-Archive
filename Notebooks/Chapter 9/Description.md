# Chapter 9
Investigates how factored action spaces can help in grouping patient states together, increasing interpretability and increasing OPE confidence, through analysis of trajectories sampled from the Sepsis Simulator.

Description of notebooks:

- **Sepsis_Simulator_State_Analysis**: This analyses the most common state sequences in trajectories observed from different start states in the Sepsis Simulator, with a view to better understanding the effects of start states, confounding factors and treatments.

- **Sepsis_Simulator_Action_Analysis**: This analyses the most common action sequences and action factor sequences in trajectories observed from different start states in the Sepsis Simulator, with a view to understanding how different action space factorisations affect the diversity in trajectory factors, variance and theability to group patient states together.
